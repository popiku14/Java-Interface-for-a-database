In this project, an interface was developed for a MySQL database utilizing two distinct technologies, namely JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Hibernate. The primary objective was to facilitate efficient data management and retrieval by leveraging the strengths of both technologies. The resulting interface was designed to be robust, secure, and user-friendly, while ensuring optimal performance and data integrity.
